# [ng-RaceSurfer](http://ng-racesurfer.aws.af.cm/)

### Project Topic and Goals
ng-RaceSurfer is a rebuild of [RaceSurfer, my ITP 404 Final project](https://github.com/hermantran/ITP404-Final-Project), using AngularJS. The purpose of this project is to learn AngularJS by migrating a Backbone-based project to using AngularJS code and structure.

### Project Features
* Uses the W3C Geolocation, Google Maps, and Active APIs
* Uses AngularJS to organize code into a MVVM pattern and to include dependency injection
* Uses RequireJS to separate code into modules with declared dependencies 
* JS structure in [laravel/public/js/](https://github.com/hermantran/ng-racesurfer/tree/master/laravel/public/js)
* [CSS structure](https://github.com/hermantran/ng-racesurfer/tree/master/laravel/public/css) follows [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) rules and is compiled and compressed with Sass
